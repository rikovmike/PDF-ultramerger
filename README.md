# PDF-ultramerger

Console utility for merging multiple PDF files into one file.

The utility allows you to combine multiple PDF documents into one PDF file. In order to do this, just drag the selected files or a folder with files onto the executable file of the utility and wait for the utility to complete.

Upon completion of the utility, a file with a new name (composed of the names of the original files) will appear next to your files, inside which there will be pages of all documents in the order determined by the file sorting in Explorer.
When you drag a folder with files onto the utility, the resulting file will be placed in the same folder.
